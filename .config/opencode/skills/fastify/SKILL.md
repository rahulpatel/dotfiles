## When to use

Use this skill when you need to:
- Develop backend applications using Fastify
- Implement Fastify plugins and route handlers
- Get guidance on Fastify architecture and patterns
- Use TypeScript with Fastify (strip types)
- Implement testing with Fastify's inject method
- Configure validation, serialization, and error handling

## How to use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

## Core Principles

- **Encapsulation**: Fastify's plugin system provides automatic encapsulation
- **Schema-first**: Define schemas for validation and serialization
- **Performance**: Fastify is optimized for speed; use its features correctly
- **Async/await**: All handlers and hooks support async functions
- **Minimal dependencies**: Prefer Fastify's built-in features and official plugins
